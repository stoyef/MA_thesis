\title{Simulate data from an HMM with AR(p) structure}
\usage{
sample_arp(n_samples, delta, Gamma, N, params, autocor, p, dists)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_samples}{Number of samples to generate.}

\item{delta}{Initial distribution of the Markov chain.}

\item{Gamma}{Transition probability matrix of the Markov chain.}

\item{N}{Number of states.}

\item{params}{Parameter vector for the different distributions. 
.              Has to respect the order specified in \code{dists}.}

\item{autocor}{List of parameter matrix (Dimensions for each matrix: \eqn{n\times p}) for the autocorrelation coefficients. 
Has to match p, in the order \eqn{\phi_{t-p},\dots,\phi_{t-1}}
where \eqn{\phi} is the vector of autocorrelation coefficients
for one specific time lag (one value for each state).
0, if no autocorrelation. Has to respect the order specified in \code{dists}.}

\item{p}{Vector of degree of autocorrelation for each distribution, 0=no autocorrelation.}

\item{dists}{Vector containing abbreviated names (in R-jargon) of the distributions 
to be considered in the Likelihood computation.}
}
\value{
List of states and data of the HMM.
}
\description{
Simulate data from an HMM with AR(p) structure. 
Different distributions can be specified in \code{dists} (uni- and multivariate).
