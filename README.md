# Master thesis
Thesis code and other things

- Simulation of HMMs with AR(p)-structure in state-dependent process
- Application to real data
- Hopefully much more soon


## ToDo

- Look over Viterbi function: How can we make sure that the order of the decoded states match the order of the simulated data? 
- Source for the constant constant coefficient of variation (some paper??)
- re-run of the simulation with 250 runs for updated functions (inclusion of sigma)
