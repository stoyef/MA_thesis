# Master Thesis
Thesis code (structured as an R-package). Additional code to generate simulations, data applications and additional tests are located in the folder non project code.

Functionalities include:
- Computation of AR(p)-HMM likelihood
- Fitting AR(p)-HMMs
- Global decoding
- Pseudo residuals
- Simulation of data from AR(p)-HMMs
- Applications to real data
